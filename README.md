## **Affirmation Bot**

Create and schedule personalized affirmations to be delivered as notifications directly to your smartwatch using this Telegram bot.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up a Telegram Bot**

1. **Create a Bot**:  
    - Open Telegram and search for `BotFather`.  
    - Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command.  
    - Provide a name and username for your bot. The username must end with "bot" (e.g., `MyCustomBot`).  
    - BotFather will provide you with a bot token (e.g., `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`).  

2. **Save the Bot Token**:  
    - Store the token securely. It will be used to send messages via the Telegram Bot API.

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Telegram User ID**

1. **Find Your User ID**:  
    - Use the bot [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).  
    - Start a chat with this bot, and it will display your Telegram user ID.  

---

### **Step 3: Update the Bot Code**

1. Open the bot script file (`my_bot.py`).  
2. Locate the following lines in the code:  

   ```python
   BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
   CHAT_ID = "your_user_id_here"
   ```
3. Replace `your_bot_token_here` with the bot token you received from BotFather.  
4. Replace `your_user_id_here` with the Telegram user ID you received from @userinfobot.  

---

### **Step 4: Configure the Time Zone**

This bot supports time zone localization for scheduling affirmations. The default time zone is set to **Asia/Kolkata**. If you need a different time zone:  

1. Locate the following line in the bot code:  
   ```python
   TIMEZONE = pytz.timezone("Asia/Kolkata")
   ```  
2. Replace `"Asia/Kolkata"` with your desired time zone.  
3. A list of supported time zones can be found in the [Python `pytz` documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/pytz/).

### **Step 5: Install Prerequisites**

Run the following commands to install the necessary Python packages (with `break-system-packages` to avoid permission issues):  

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot --break-system-packages
pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue]" --break-system-packages
```

### **Step 6: Set Up an AWS Free Tier EC2 Instance**

The author ran this bot on an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance (Free Tier)**. AWS Free Tier provides a way to explore cloud computing for free.  

1. **Why AWS Free Tier?**  
   AWS Free Tier includes 750 hours of t2.micro instances per month for 12 months, sufficient for small projects like this bot.  

2. **Set Up Your EC2 Instance**:  
   - Search for easy walkthroughs on platforms like [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), or [Medium](https://medium.com/) using keywords like:  
     - *"Set up AWS Free Tier account"*  
     - *"Launch Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS Free Tier"*  

3. **Update and Upgrade Your Machine**:  
   After launching your EC2 instance, always run:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```  
   This ensures the machine has the latest software and prevents unexpected errors.

### **Step 7: Run the Bot in a tmux Session**

1. Install `tmux`:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install tmux
   ```  
2. Start a new tmux session:  
   ```bash
   tmux new -s affirmation_bot
   ```  
3. Run the bot script inside the tmux session:  
   ```bash
   python3 my_bot.py
   ```  
4. Detach from the session:  
   ```bash
   Ctrl+b, then press d
   ```  
   This keeps the bot running even if you close the terminal.  

---

### **Usage**

- **Start the Bot**: Use the `/start` command to initialize the bot.  
- **Add an Affirmation**: Use the `/add <HH:MM> <message>` command to schedule an affirmation (e.g., `/add 08:00 You are amazing!`). The time is to be entered in **24 hour format.**
- **List Affirmations**: Use the `/list` command to see all scheduled affirmations.  
- **Remove an Affirmation**: Use the `/remove <ID>` command to delete an affirmation by its ID.

**Note:**
The code was written with the assistance of ChatGPT and required nearly 30 iterations to achieve the desired functionality.

**Timing Behavior:**
Please note that the affirmation appears exactly one minute later than the defined time. This behavior is intentional based on how the botâ€™s job queue scheduling is set up, and it should not be considered an error.

Here's the refined disclaimer or note you can add to the README:

### **Disclaimer on Receiving Affirmations on Smartwatch**  
To receive the affirmation notifications on your smartwatch, please ensure the following:  
1. **Active Internet and Bluetooth**: Keep your smartphone's internet connection and Bluetooth enabled.
2. **Smartwatch Pairing**: Ensure that your smartwatch is properly paired with your smartphone.
3. **Telegram Notifications**: To ensure that only affirmation notifications are received, I recommend muting all other Telegram groups and chats, leaving only the bot unmuted. This strategy helps in avoiding interruptions and ensures that you get the affirmations as intended.
